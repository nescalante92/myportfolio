# myportfolio
## Description
In this assignment the goal was to create my portfolio in which I can showcase my technical skills to show potential employers my work. 



## User Story
For this assignemnt I felt very overwelmed. I had trouble grasping the technical skills that are required to create a succeful portfolio. My biggest issues were that I failed to properly sctructure my html and focused too much on my css. I underestimated my wireframing structure. Media queries are also missing from this assighnment which would allow users to view my portfolio from different devices.


## Acceptance Criteria 
-Potential employers can view previous work
when portfolio is loaded

-The developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them are presented

-The links in the navigation correspond as UI scrolls to the corresponding section

-There are links to each section about their work correspond as UI scrolls to a section with the titled images of the developer's applications

-The developer's first application's image should be larger in size than the others

-When images on applications are clicked they deploy application

-When page is resized to view the site on various screens and devices
the layout is responsive and adapts to my UI viewport
